# Getting started with MyWork server

This project was created using django_rest_framework (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework).

## Starting the server

In the project directory, you can run:

### `python manage.py runserver`

This will run the server locally on your machine.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
